3. Backend communicates with Shopify's REST API
4. Responses are processed and returned to the frontend
5. UI updates with real-time data

## Getting Started

## TypeScript Types

The integration includes comprehensive TypeScript types for all Shopify entities:

- `ShopifyProduct` - Product information and variants
- `ShopifyOrder` - Order details and line items
- `ShopifyCustomer` - Customer profiles and addresses
- `ShopifyCart` - Shopping cart and line items
- `ShopifyStoreStats` - Store performance metrics

## Customization

### Adding New Features
1. Create new components in `src/components/shopify/`
2. Add corresponding API methods in `src/lib/shopifyApi.ts`
3. Update types in `src/types/shopify.ts`
4. Integrate with the main dashboard

### Styling
The components use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for consistent styling. Customize the appearance by modifying the component classes or creating new UI components.

### Chatbot Responses
Customize the chatbot by modifying the `generateBotResponse` function in `ShopifyChatbot.tsx`. Add new response patterns and suggestions based on your store's specific needs.

## Security Considerations

- All API calls go through authenticated backend endpoints
- No Shopify API keys are exposed in the frontend
- User authentication is handled by the existing auth system
- API rate limiting is implemented on the backend

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of components and data
- Efficient filtering and search algorithms
- Optimized API calls with proper caching
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Errors**
   - Verify backend URL configuration
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure backend services are running

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify user login status
   - Check API token validity
   - Ensure proper permissions

3. **Data Loading Problems**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API response format
   - Check network tab for failed requests

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed reporting and insights
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass product and order updates
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with other e-commerce platforms
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for store management
- **AI Features**: Advanced product recommendations and customer insights
